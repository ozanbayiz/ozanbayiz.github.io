I updated the `idarve` project page and fixed some LaTeX stuff in `proj5b`.

I tried to fix Figures on `proj2` but I could feel my life energy draining
and said "no I'll do this later".

Notable progress before this include:
- MDX w/ LaTeX
- collapsible nested sidebar that highlights the currently viewed page 
(TODO: the code for this sucks)
- Navigation breadcrumbs
- Lightbox to view figures in fullscreen
- Mostly~ migrated my old CS180 project pages
- Re-writing my CS182 "written submission" as a "blogpost"

export const meta = { layout: 'project' }
