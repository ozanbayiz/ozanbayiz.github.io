## Introduction

The first thing I did was search for metrics for image alignment that are invariant to difference in brightness levels between channels. 
CS 170 gave me some insights into the wide applications of working in the frequency domain. 
This got me thinking about a sentence on the website mentioning how 
"""
you might have to use a cleverer metric, or different features than the raw pixels.
"""

Ok..

## Phase Correlation

I stumbled on [phase correlation](https://sthoduka.github.io/imreg_fmt/docs/phase-correlation/). Turns out that the maximum index (i,j) of the phase correlation matrix corresponds to the best shift. Implemented it and tried it out:

sweet. done? But I still had to implement the image pyramid.

## Image Pyramid

<Figure src="/projects/cs180/proj1/onion_church_pyramid.png" alt="Onion Church Pyramid" caption="Image pyramid illustration for Onion Church across scales." />

At each level, I divided the height/width of the query image by a power of 2. Each iteration would displace the query image 1 px up, down, left, and right, then pick the shift which yielded the highest metric.

Getting the metric involved:

- applying the shift with np.roll
- cropping the image to the inner 0.8*W x 0.8*H px, since the border was interfering with the metric function's results
- applying the metric function

At first I tried MSE & NCC as metric functions. These didn't work so I went back online and found NGD, which also didn't really work (but maybe I was just being impatient). Eventually I found the [Structural Similarity Index Measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity_index_measure) [(and its scikit-image documentation)](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/transform/plot_ssim.html), which gave me pretty good results.

This worked fine (~15sec/TIF). Still lot slower than the phase correlation approach. I'm not super patient so the result images are those I got using phase correlation.
